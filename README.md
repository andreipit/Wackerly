I am going through Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly et al. 7th Edition for my own self study. While this book is typically used for a second year sequence in statistics, I think it is appropriate for self study for 2 reasons:

1. The book strikes a balance between theory and application. I am interested in both proving the utility of my statistical tools, and implementing those tools.
2. I am attempting to build a foundation of statistical knowledge which will help me study more advanced topics. When I read more advanced books like Elements of Statistical Learning, by Hastie et al., I often am confused by some finer details. Mathematical Statistics with Applications is meant to be a starting point which exposes me to various topics that I can further explore in my own time.

I will occasionally update this repository with more notebooks and written solutions. My motivation for doing this is to obtain a deeper understanding of statistics and obtain the skills to captilaize on any projects I may be interested in. If you see any errors in my solutions, feel free to point them out and I will make any corrections necessary. Again, the purpose of this repository is not to create an answer key, but use for self study. 

I pace myself at solving 20 problems per day, but I do not plan to upload any further sections until I have finished writing the section's solutions in LaTeX. As I go through the textbook, I will use Google Collab for any plotting and tedious computations.

Feel free to recommend a textbook you think builds upon Wackerly et al.'s Mathematical Statistics with Applications. I plan to continue going through more textbooks for my own self study.

I impose certain rules upon myself to properly study the material. 
- I will not use any tools not yet introduced by the author unless absolutely necessary. 

For example, in Chapter 1, there are numerous problems asking about the probability of certain values on normal distributions. Since the normal distribution had yet to be formally introduced and these problems are in the same section as the Empirical Rule, I solve these problems using the Empirical Rule. While I could obtain a more accurate answer by calculating the probability density function of a problem's normal distribution, I believe this foundational approach will encourage me to better master the material.

On the other hand, I will point out whenever I need to make an assumption or utilize a tool not yet established in the textbook. These instances include using proof by induction to solve counting related identities, or when calculating moment generating functions in Section 3.9, it becomes necessary to assume the moment generating function is finite for our choice of t. While we could prove there exists values for which *m(t)* is finite, the tools needed to do so are usually beyond the scope of the text. I may change my mind on this once I complete the book and go back to make corrections.

- I will solve every problem in the book

This rule is so that I do not get lazy later and refuse to solve some tedious problems or skip certain sections.
